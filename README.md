feathertooth
============

Feather form factor (but no USB code upload) SiLabs BGM113 carrier.

USB-C version. Not layed out yet. Need to fix mistakes from previous version:

- No diode to provide USB power if battery not charged
- Many of the BGM113 pins are connected internally, routing
  to the feather pins could be improved
